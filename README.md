# Parent Repository Overview

This parent repository encompasses three distinct projects, each focusing on different aspects of machine learning and data analysis. Below, you will find a brief introduction to each project, along with a link to their specific README files for more detailed information.

## Projects

### 1. Gender_Recognition
- **Description**: This project aims to classify gender using a Neural Network (NN).
- **Objective**: Develop and train a neural network model to accurately classify gender based on input data.
- **Details**: More information, including datasets, model architecture, and results, can be found in the project's README file.
- **Directory**: `Gender_Recognition`

### 2. Hackaton
- **Description**: This project focuses on adjusting a linear model to the data following a thorough statistical analysis.
- **Objective**: Conduct statistical analysis to understand the data and then fit a linear model to make accurate predictions.
- **Details**: More information, including data preprocessing, statistical methods used, and model evaluation, can be found in the project's README file.
- **Directory**: `Hackaton`

### 3. NanoFilm_Optimization
- **Description**: This project aims to find the optimal values of nanofilm composite's thickness to achieve optimal solar absorption.
- **Objective**: Use machine learning techniques to determine the best thickness combinations for Ta2O5, Al2O3, and SiO2 layers to minimize reflectance around a 600 nm wavelength.
- **Details**: More information, including the machine learning model used, data sources, and optimization results, can be found in the project's README file.
- **Directory**: `NanoFilm_Optimization`
