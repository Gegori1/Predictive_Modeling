# GENDER-RECOGNITION-MODELS

This module contains code for creating models to recognize gender given an image.

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can predict the gender of a person based on an input image. This module includes functions and classes for training and evaluating these models.

## Usage
- Import this module to access the functions and classes.
- Use the provided functions to train and evaluate gender recognition models.

## Modules Included

- **`NN`**: Contains the models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- **`label_data`**: Contains functions for labeling the data.
